## 📖 About The Project

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers. It transfers data in plain text, which makes it vulnerable to cyber attacks.

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data during transmission, ensuring privacy, integrity, and authentication.
