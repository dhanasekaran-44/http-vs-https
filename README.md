HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) are protocols used to transfer data between a web browser and a server. HTTP sends data in plain text, making it less secure, while HTTPS encrypts the data using SSL/TLS, ensuring safe and secure communication over the internet.
   🧠 Why HTTPS is Important
      HTTPS protects sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, and personal data. It also builds user trust, enables secure transactions, and improves search engine rankings.
      📂 Use Cases
            Banking Websites
            E-commerce Platforms
            Login & Signup Pages
            Payment Gateways.
🏁 Conclusion
        HTTPS is the modern standard for secure web communication. Implementing HTTPS ensures data privacy, security, and reliability for all web applications.
